    <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
 <h2>Acknowledgments</h2>
 <div class="container">
 <div class="row">
         <div class="zzz col-md-6"><p>As with any book, what's written here has a great deal to do with the many people who have worked with me in various ways over the years. Lots of people have helped in
             lots of ways. Often I don't recall important things people said that went into this book, but I can acknowledge those contributions I do remember.</p>
          <p>I'll start with my contributors. David Rice, a colleague of mine at ThoughtWorks, has made a huge contribution â€” a good tenth of the book. As we worked hard
            to hit the deadline (while he was also supporting a client), we had several late-night instant message conversations where he confessed to finally seeing
            why writing a book is both so hard and so compulsive.</p>
		</div>
		
        <div class="yyy col-md-6"><p>Kyle Brown, Rachel Reinitz, and Bobby Woolf have gone out of their way to have long and detailed review sessions with me in North Carolina. Their 
        fine-tooth comb has injected all sorts of wisdom, not including this particularly heinous mixed metaphor. In particular I've enjoyed several long
        telephone calls with Kyle that contributed more than I can list.</p>
        <p>Early in 2000 I prepared a talk for Java One with Alan Knight and Kai Yu that was the earliest genesis of this material. As well as thanking them
        for their help in that, I should also thank Josh Mackenzie, Rebecca Parsons, and Dave Rice for helping me refine these talks, and the ideas, later on. Jim
        Newkirk did a great deal in helping me get used to the new world of .NET.</p></div>
	</div>
	<div class="row">	
        <div class="rrr col-md-6"><p>I've learned a lot from the many people working in this field with whom I've had good conversations and collaborations. In particular I'd like to thank
        Colleen Roe, David Muirhead, a of the UIUC Balaguer, nd Weerasak Witthawaskul.</p></div>
	
        <div class="bbb col-md-4 col-md-offset-2"><p>Dragos Manolescu, an ex-UIUC hitman, got his own group together to give me feedback. My thanks to Muhammad Anan, Brian Doyle, Emad Ghosheh, Glenn Graessle,
        Daniel Hein, Prabhaharan Kumarakulasingam, Joe Quint, John Reinke, Kevin Reynolds, Sripriya Srinivasan, and Tirumala Vaddiraju.
        Kent Beck has given me more good ideas than I can remember. But I do remember that he came up with the name for Special Case (496). Jim Odell was
        responsible for getting me into the world of consulting, teaching, and writing - no acknowledgment will ever do his help justice.</p></div>

	<div class="row">
        <div class="mmm col-md-3"><p> John Coakley, Bob Corrick, Pascal Costanza, Andy Czerwonka, Martin Diehl, Daniel Drasin, Juan Gomez Duaso,
        Don Dwiggins, Peter Foreman, Russell Freeman, Peter Gassmann, Jason Gorman, Dan Green, Lars Gregori, Rick Hansen, Tobin Harris, Russel Healey,
        Christian Heller, Richard Henderson, Kyle Hermenean, Carsten Heyl, Akira Hi</div>
        <div class="fff col-md-9"><p>There are many others who gave input whose names I either never knew or can't remember, but my thanks is no less heartfelt.</p>
        <p>My biggest thanks is, as ever, to my wife Cindy, whose company I appreciate much more than anyone can appreciate this book.</p></div>
